## Requirements

The `dci-openshift-app-agent` is packaged and available as a RPM file located in [this repository](https://packages.distributed-ci.io/dci-release.el8.noarch.rpm). It can be installed with the following command:

```bash
dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
dnf -y install https://packages.distributed-ci.io/dci-release.el8.noarch.rpm
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
dnf -y install dci-openshift-app-agent
```

Once installed, to execute the `dci-openshift-app-agent`, a running OpenShift cluster, together with the credentials needed to make use of the cluster (i.e. through the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable) are needed.

The OpenShift cluster can be built beforehand by running the [DCI OpenShift Agent](https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-openshift-agent) with the proper configuration to install the desired OCP version. 

Once installed, you need to export the `kubeconfig` file from the provisionhost (usually located in `~/clusterconfigs/auth/kubeconfig`) to the host in which `dci-openshift-app-agent` is executed. Then, you have set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the path to the kubeconfig file in that host with `export KUBECONFIG=<path_to_kubeconfig>` 

These instructions applies when using the `dci-openshift-app-agent` over both baremetal and virtual machines (libvirt) environments.

## Configuration

There are two configuration files for `dci-openshift-app-agent`: `/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/dcirc.sh` and `/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/settings.yml`.

- `/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/dcirc.sh`

Note: The initial copy of `dcirc.sh` is shipped as `/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/dcirc.sh.dist`.

Copy this to `/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/dcirc.sh` to get started, then replace inline some values with your own credentials.

From the web the [DCI web dashboard](https://www.distributed-ci.io), the partner team administrator has to create a `Remote CI` in the DCI web dashboard.

Copy the relative credential and paste it locally on the Jumpbox to `/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/dcirc.sh`.

This file should be edited once:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
DCI_CS_URL="https://api.distributed-ci.io/"
DCI_CLIENT_ID=remoteci/<remoteci_id>
DCI_API_SECRET=<remoteci_api_secret>
export DCI_CLIENT_ID
export DCI_API_SECRET
export DCI_CS_URL
```

- `/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/settings.yml`

This file allows to provide some variables to the DCI OpenShift App Agent for configuration purposes. Main variables available (mainly related to the [CNF Cert Suite](https://github.com/test-network-function/test-network-function)) are the following:

Not to be used for versions equal or lower to v2.0.0

## Launching the agent

Once the agent is configured, you can start it as a service.

Please note that the service is a systemd `Type=oneshot`. This means that if you need to run a DCI job periodically, you have to configure a `systemd timer` or a `crontab`.

```ShellSession
# systemctl start dci-openshift-app-agent
```

If you need to run the `dci-openshift-app-agent` manually in foreground,
you can use this command line:

```ShellSession
# su - dci-openshift-app-agent
$ dci-openshift-app-agent-ctl -s
```

### Using customized tags

To replay any steps, please use Ansible tags (--tags). Please refer to [Workflow](#workflow) section to understand the steps that compose the `dci-openshift-app-agent`.

```ShellSession
# su - dci-openshift-app-agent
$ dci-openshift-app-agent-ctl -s -- --tags job,pre-run,running,post-run
```

or to avoid one or multiple steps, use `--skip-tags`:

```ShellSession
# su - dci-openshift-app-agent
$ dci-openshift-app-agent-ctl -s -- --skip-tags testing
```

Possible tags are:

- `job`
- `dci`
- `kubeconfig`
- `pre-run`
- `redhat-pre-run`
- `partner-pre-run`
- `install`
- `running`
- `testing`
- `redhat-testing`
- `partner-testing`
- `post-run`
- `success`

As the `KUBECONFIG` is read from the `kubeconfig` tasks, this tag should always be included.

The `dci` tag can be used to skip all DCI calls else the `job` tag is
mandatory to initialize all the DCI specifics. You will need to
provide a fake `job_info` variable in a `myvars.yml` file like this:

```YAML
job_id: fake-id
job_info:
  job:
    components:
    - name: 1.0.0
      type: my-component
```

and then call the agent like this:

```ShellSession
# su - dci-openshift-app-agent
$ dci-openshift-app-agent-ctl -s -- --skip-tags dci -e @myvars.yml
```

## General workflow

The `dci-openshift-app-agent` is an Ansible playbook that enables Cloud-Native Applications and Operators in OpenShift using Red Hat Distributed CI service. The main entrypoint is the file `dci-openshift-app-agent.yml`. It is composed of several steps executed sequentially.

In case of an issue, the agent will terminate its execution by launching (optionally) the teardown and failure playbooks.

There are two fail statuses:

- `failure` - Whenever there's an issue with either the installation of the application or during testing.
- `error` - Whenever there's an error anywhere else during the playbook.

## Hooks

Files located in `/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/hooks/` need to be filled by the user.

They will NOT be replaced when the `dci-openshift-app-agent` RPM is updated.

The hooks that can be defined are the following:

```bash
├── hooks
│   ├── pre-run.yml
│   ├── install.yml
│   ├── tests.yml
│   ├── post-run.yml
│   └── teardown.yml
```

### Pre-run

This hook is used for preparation steps required in the `jumphost` or anywhere else _outside the cluster_. For example, it could be used to install some packages required in the `jumphost` or to report the state of the cluster before starting.

This hook is not required and can be omitted.

Tags:

- `pre-run`

### Install

This is the main hook that must take care of install and/or configure the application in the cluster.

This hook is required and will fail if not available.

Tags:

- `install`
- `running`

### Tests

The tests hook is used to test the application in the install hook, this hook verifies and/or validates the install step in the cluster.

This hook is not required and can be omitted, but is highly recommended to define a way to validate/verify the installed application.

Tags:

- `testing`
- `running`

### Post-run

This hook is used for tasks required after the application has been installed and/or validated. For example, to upload logs to a central location, or to report the state of the application.

This hook is not required and can be omitted.

Tags:

- `post-run`

### Teardown

While this hook is not required it is highly recommended to be included. Its main purpose is to remove or destroy anything that was created with the install and/or the test hooks.

This hook is controlled with two variables:

- `dci_teardown_on_success` (default: true)
- `dci_teardown_on_failure` (default: false)

It's included either when there's a failure, error or at the end of all the steps.

## Known issues

- If you want to test the CNF Cert Suite in a libvirt environment, remember to tag the OCP nodes to fit in the NodeSelector property defined in partner's pod (`NodeSelectors: role=partner`):

```bash
# for X in 0:n, with n = { number of master nodes - 1 }
oc label node master-X role=partner
```
