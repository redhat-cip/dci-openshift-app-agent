# DCI OpenShift App Agent

`dci-openshift-app-agent` enables Cloud-Native Applications and Operators in OpenShift using Red Hat Distributed CI service.
This agent is expected to be installed in a RHEL8 server (from now on referred as jumphost) with access to the API of an already deployed OCP cluster.

## Requirements

Before starting make sure the next list of items are covered in the jumphost server.

- Be running the latest stable RHEL release (**8.4 or higher**) and registered via RHSM
- Ansible 2.9 (See section [Newer Ansible Versions](#newer-ansible-versions) for newer Ansible versions)
- Access to the Internet, it could be through a proxy (See section [Proxy Considerations](#proxy-considerations))
- Access to the following repositories:
  - epel
  - dci-release
  - baseos-rpms
  - appstream-rpms
- Podman 3.0 (See section [Old Podman versions](#old-podman-versions) for older Podman versions)
- Kubernetes Python module

In an already registered server with RHEL you can fullfil the repositories and Ansible 2.9 requirements with the following commands:

```ShellSession
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable ansible-2.9-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
# dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
# dnf -y install https://packages.distributed-ci.io/dci-release.el8.noarch.rpm
```

Please make sure that you have followed these steps before continuing. Then, install Kubernetes module:

```ShellSession
# dnf install python3-kubernetes
```

> NOTE: Another option is to use pip3, and you can use a more recent version of the module, however it is not recommended.

## Installation

The `dci-openshift-app-agent` is packaged and available as a RPM file located in [this repository](https://packages.distributed-ci.io/dci-release.el8.noarch.rpm). It can be installed in the jumphost server with the following command:

```ShellSession
# dnf -y install dci-openshift-app-agent
```

In order to execute the `dci-openshift-app-agent`, a running OpenShift cluster, together with the credentials needed to make use of the cluster (i.e. through the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable) are needed. Also, make sure that `dci-openshift-agent` has been installed in your system after installing `dci-openshift-app-agent`.

The OpenShift cluster can be built beforehand by running the [DCI OpenShift Agent](https://github.com/redhat-cip/dci-openshift-agent) with the proper configuration to install the desired OCP version.

Once installed, you need to export the `kubeconfig` from the jumphost to the host in which `dci-openshift-app-agent` is executed. Then, you have set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the path to the kubeconfig file in that host with `export KUBECONFIG=<path_to_kubeconfig>`

NOTE: If you followed the instructions of DCI OpenShift Agent to deploy the cluster, the `kubeconfig` file is on the provisionhost (usually located in `~/clusterconfigs/auth/kubeconfig`)

These instructions applies when using the `dci-openshift-app-agent` over both baremetal and virtual machines (libvirt) environments.

## Configuration

There are two configuration files for `dci-openshift-app-agent`:

1. **/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/dcirc.sh**

    From the [DCI web dashboard](https://www.distributed-ci.io), the partner team administrator has to create a `Remote CI` in the DCI web dashboard. Copy the relative credential and paste it locally on the Jumphost to `/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/dcirc.sh`.

    This file should be edited once:

```ShellSession
#!/usr/bin/env bash
DCI_CS_URL="https://api.distributed-ci.io/"
DCI_CLIENT_ID=remoteci/<remoteci_id>
DCI_API_SECRET=<remoteci_api_secret>
export DCI_CLIENT_ID
export DCI_API_SECRET
export DCI_CS_URL
```

    > NOTE: The initial copy of `dcirc.sh` is shipped as `/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/dcirc.sh.dist`. You can copy this to `/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/dcirc.sh` to get started, then replace inline some values with your own credentials.

1. **/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/settings.yml**

    This file allows to provide some variables to the DCI OpenShift App Agent. The table below shows the available variables and their default values.

Name                               | Default                                              | Description

In that case, it must include the creds for the local registry used, and optionally have private registry creds for partners. If it is a connected environment, this variable is optional and, if it has a value, the file would contain just private registry creds for partners.

A minimal configuration is required for the DCI OpenShift App Agent to run, before launching the agent, make sure you have the following:

1. In /etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/settings.yml these variables are required, see their definitions in the table above. You can also define this variables in a different form, see section [Using customized tags](#using-customized-tags) below where a fake `job_info` is created.

    ```YAML
    dci_topic:
    dci_components_by_query:
    dci_comment:
    ```

1. The DCI OpenShift App Agent by default runs a series of Ansible playbooks called hooks in phases (see section [Hooks](#hooks)). The default files only contain the string `---` and no actions are performed. The install.yml is missing on purpose, and if you run the agent at this point, you will receive an error. In that case you can choose between one of the following options to proceed:

    - Create install.yml file with the string `---` and no actions will be performed at this phase.
    - Create install.yml with your own tasks. (You might also consider provide tasks for all the phases: pre-run, tests, post-run, teardown)
    - Include dci_config_dir variable in `settings.yml` with the path where the hooks you want to execute are located.

    > See section [Examples](#examples) for basic configurations of settings.yml to start using the agent.

## Launching the agent

The agent can be executed manually or through systemd, once the agent is configured, you can start it either way.

### Running it manually

If you need to run the `dci-openshift-app-agent` manually in foreground, you can use this command line:

```ShellSession
# su - dci-openshift-app-agent
$ dci-openshift-app-agent-ctl -s
```

### Running it as a service

If you prefer to launch a job with systemd, start the dci-openshift-app-agent service

```ShellSession
# systemctl start dci-openshift-app-agent
```

> Please note that the service is a systemd `Type=oneshot`. This means that if you need to run a DCI job periodically, you have to configure a `systemd timer` or a `crontab`.

### Using customized tags

To replay any steps, the use of Ansible tags (--tags) is an option. Please refer to [Workflow](#workflow) section to understand the steps that compose the `dci-openshift-app-agent`.

```ShellSession
# su - dci-openshift-app-agent
$ dci-openshift-app-agent-ctl -s -- --tags kubeconfig,job,pre-run,running,post-run
```

or to avoid one or multiple steps, use `--skip-tags`:

```ShellSession
# su - dci-openshift-app-agent
$ dci-openshift-app-agent-ctl -s -- --skip-tags testing
```

Possible tags are:

- `job`
- `dci`
- `kubeconfig`
- `pre-run`
- `redhat-pre-run`
- `partner-pre-run`
- `install`
- `running`
- `testing`
- `redhat-testing`
- `partner-testing`
- `post-run`
- `success`

As the `KUBECONFIG` is read from the `kubeconfig` tasks, this tag should always be included.

The `dci` tag can be used to skip all DCI calls else the `job` tag is mandatory to initialize
all the DCI specifics. If you cannot do the DCI calls, you just need to call the agent like this:

```ShellSession
# su - dci-openshift-app-agent
$ dci-openshift-app-agent-ctl -s -- --skip-tags dci
```

## Enabling the Test Suites in DCI App Agent

The DCI App Agent has support to execute multiple test suites to validate containers, virtual functions, Helm charts, and operators. The suites are in the form of Ansible roles executed during the Red Hat testing phases. The suites help the partners on getting prepared for the Red Hat Certifications or actually run the certification process on the the workloads deployed via DCI.

The variables that control the tests execution can be added as part or the `settting.yml` file (see above).

### Operator Certification tests

This test suite will run the command line interface for validating if OpenShift Operator Bundles and images meet minimum requirements for Red Hat [Operator Certification](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/openshift-preflight).

For specific details about the features and variables for this test suite see: [Preflight role](roles/preflight/README.md) documentation.

The test results for each operator can be submitted to the [Red Hat connect Site](https://connect.redhat.com/). Please see [Preflight Role](roles/preflight/README.md) documentation about how to enable this feature.

### Cloud Native Functions (CNF) Certification tests

The [CNF-cert role](roles/cnf-cert/README.md) allows the deployment of CNFs and run the defined [Tests Network Funcions (TNF)](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test) in the order to meet minimum requirements for Red Hat OpenShift Certification.

For specific details about the features and variables for this test suite see: [CNF-cert role](roles/cnf-cert/README.md) documentation.

Also, the [tnf_test_example sample](samples/tnf_test_example/README.md) can be followed as a good example of how to deploy a workload to be tested by the CNF Cert Suite.

### Helm Chart Verifier

[Helm Chart Verifier](https://github.com/redhat-certification/chart-verifier) is a test tool that validates Helm charts based on Red Hat recommendations.

The [chart-verifier role](roles/chart-verifier/README.md) is able to deploy charts on an OCP cluster and run the helm chart verifier tests. Please see the role documentation for more details about how to run tests using via the app agent or using a pipeline.

## General workflow

The `dci-openshift-app-agent` is an Ansible playbook that enables Cloud-Native Applications and Operators in OpenShift using Red Hat Distributed CI service. The main entrypoint is the file `dci-openshift-app-agent.yml`. It is composed of several steps executed sequentially.

In case of an issue, the agent will terminate its execution by launching (optionally) the teardown and failure playbooks.

There are two fail statuses:

- `failure` - Whenever there's an issue with either the installation of the application or during testing.
- `error` - Whenever there's an error anywhere else during the playbook.

All the tasks prefixed with test_ will get exported in Junit using the Ansible Junit callback and submitted automatically to the DCI control server.

## Hooks

Files located in `/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/hooks/` need to be filled by the user.

They will NOT be replaced when the `dci-openshift-app-agent` RPM is updated.

The hooks that can be defined are the following:

```ShellSession
├── hooks
│   ├── pre-run.yml
│   ├── install.yml
│   ├── tests.yml
│   ├── post-run.yml
│   └── teardown.yml
```

### Pre-run

This hook is used for preparation steps required in the `jumphost` or anywhere else _outside the cluster_. For example, it could be used to install some packages required in the `jumphost` or to report the state of the cluster before starting.

This hook is not required and can be omitted.

Tags:

- `pre-run`

### Install

This is the main hook that must take care of install and/or configure the application in the cluster.

This hook is required and will fail if not available.

Tags:

- `install`
- `running`

### Tests

The tests hook is used to test the application in the install hook, this hook verifies and/or validates the install step in the cluster.

This hook is not required and can be omitted, but is highly recommended to define a way to validate/verify the installed application.

Tags:

- `testing`
- `running`

### Post-run

This hook is used for tasks required after the application has been installed and/or validated. For example, to upload logs to a central location, or to report the state of the application.

This hook is not required and can be omitted.

You can put your logs in {{ job\_logs.path }} and they will be uploaded in plays/post-run.yml

Tags:

- `post-run`

### Teardown

While this hook is not required it is highly recommended to be included. Its main purpose is to remove or destroy anything that was created with the install and/or the test hooks.

This hook is controlled with two variables:

- `dci_teardown_on_success` (default: true)
- `dci_teardown_on_failure` (default: false)

It's included either when there's a failure, error or at the end of all the steps.

## Examples

Some examples of hooks are provided in the $HOME directory of the `dci-openshift-app-agent` user (/var/lib/dci-openshift-app-agent/samples/). You can use those to initialize the agent tests.
To use these samples, you need to include the variable `dci_config_dir` with the path of the sample to use in the settings.yml.

> NOTE: Please check the README.md for more information of how to use the examples.

1. To create a namespace and webserver pod, validate is running, and delete it, the settings.yml file will look like this:

    File: settings.yml

    ```YAML
    dci_topic: OCP-4.8
    dci_components_by_query: ['4.8.13']
    dci_comment: "Test webserver"
    dci_openshift_app_ns: testns
    dci_config_dir: /var/lib/dci-openshift-app-agent/samples/basic_example
    ```

## Overloading settings and hooks directories

To allow storing the settings and the hooks in a different directory,
you can set `/etc/dci-openshift-agent/config` like this:

```console
CONFIG_DIR=/var/lib/dci-openshift-app-agent/config
```

This will allow you to use a version control system for all your settings.

If you want to also store the hooks in the same directory, you have to specify `dci_config_dir` in your `settings.yml`. Example:

```YAML
---
dci_config_dir: [/var/lib/dci-openshift-app-agent/config]
```

## Storing secrets

You can store secrets in an encrypted manner in your `settings.yml` and YAML inventories by using `dci-vault` to generate your encrypted secrets. Details in the [python-dciclient documentation](/python-dciclient/).

## Generated files

### removed_api.txt

If the agent is ran on an OCP cluster superior or equal to 4.9, it is
creating a `removed_api.txt` file that is attached to the DCI job. This
file is listing the removed API in the upcoming OCP releases.

### diff-jobs.txt

The agent generates the `diff-jobs.txt` file in its post-run stage to
compare the previous job of the same type regarding the components
used.

## Development mode

You can launch the agent from a local copy by passing the `-d` command line option:

```ShellSession
$ dci-openshift-app-agent-ctl -s -d
```

`dcirc.sh` is read from the current directory instead of `/etc/dci-openshift-app-agent/dcirc.sh`.

You can override the location of `dci-ansible` using the `DCI_ANSIBLE_DIR` environment variable.

You can add extra paths for Ansible roles using the
`DCI_ANSIBLE_ROLES` environment variable separating paths by `:`.

## Known issues

### Libvirt Considerations

If you want to test the CNF Cert Suite in a libvirt environment, remember to tag the OCP nodes to fit in the NodeSelector property defined in partner's pod (`NodeSelectors: role=partner`):

```ShellSession
# for X in 0:n, with n = { number of master nodes - 1 }
oc label node master-X role=partner
```

### Newer Ansible Versions

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 defaults to Ansible 2.9 installed from Ansible or base repositories, it is highly recommended to use this version because using Ansible >= 2.10 requires newer versions of other python modules that can affect your entire server. You can install Ansible 2.10 or Ansible core (2.11) via other methods, but because starting at 2.10 the use of collections has introduced some changes, you need to install a few collections to make it work

After installing the agent, login as dci-openshift-app-agent user and install the following collections

```ShellSession
# su - dci-openshift-app-agent
$ ansible-galaxy collection install community.kubernetes
$ ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```

Also the use of newer Ansible versions requires a recent version of the kubernetes python module ( >= 12.0.0), as today only available through pip3

You can upgrade the current version for the dci-openshift-app-agent user only or install a specific version like this:

```ShellSession
$ python3 -m pip install -U kubernetes --user
# or
$ python3 -m pip install kubernetes==12.0.1 --user
```

#### Upgrading Ansible version

In this section from the [Ansible documentation web page](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#upgrading-ansible-with-pip), you can find the instructions to be followed to upgrade Ansible to a newer version.

Apart from that, it is recommended to do the following:

- Remove all Ansible packages installed via dnf
- Remove dci-* packages if already installed
- Reboot the jumphost (i.e. the server where dci-openshift-app-agent is executed)
- Reinstall Ansible from pip/pip3 as recommended in the documentation
- Reinstall dci packages

And check that everything works.

### Permissions to use Topics

You might encounter an error when running the dci-openshift-app-agent for first time with the message `Topic: XYZ Resource not found` the reasons could be the following:

- Incorrect spelling of the Topic. Login to the [DCI web dashboard](https://www.distributed-ci.io) and go to the `Topics` section in the left menu. There you could find the correct names and Topics available to use.
- If spelling is correct, then this might be a permissions issue. Ask the partner team administrator to verify the permissions on the group your account belongs.

### Remote access to provisioner to retrieve logs

Note that have to add the SSH public key of the user that runs the "dci-openshift-app-agent-ctl" command to SSH `provisioner_name` with `provisioner_user`, in case you want to retrieve logs from the OCP deployment, such as must-gather.

Moreover, you need to define these two variables, `provisioner_name` and `provisioner_user`, in your settings file.

### Problems related to UIDs while running containers with podman in localhost

Conditions in which the issue appeared:

- dci-openshift-app-agent installed.
- Execution of dci-openshift-app-agent directly using dci-openshift-app-agent-ctl, with the dci-openshift-app-agent user.
- Attempt to run a container, using podman, in localhost (e.g. tnf container for running the CNF Cert Suite).

Under these conditions, the error presented is the following (there may be other different errors, but all related to the same issue - lack of IDs available):

```Log
Error processing tar file(exit status 1): there might not be enough IDs available in the namespace (requested 0:5 for /usr/bin/write): lchown /usr/bin/write: invalid argument
 Error: unable to pull quay.io/testnetworkfunction/cnf-certification-test:unstable: unable to pull image: Error committing the finished image: error adding layer with blob "sha256:0a3cf4c29951bdca5c283957249a78290fb441c4ef2ce74f51815056e4be7e7f": Error processing tar file(exit status 1): there might not be enough IDs available in the namespace (requested 0:5 for /usr/bin/write): lchown /usr/bin/write: invalid argument

The problem seems to be related to the subordinate user and group mapping applied for the dci-openshift-app-agent user, a feature that is needed to run rootless containers in podman, or to isolate containers with a user namespace.

This issue has already been fixed by removing -r option when creating the dci-openshift-app-agent user in dci-openshift-app-agent.spec file. But, in case you installed dci-openshift-app-agent prior to this patch (you can check it by looking at /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid files, confirming that no entries related to dci-openshift-app-agent user are present there), you have to follow these steps:

1. Check the content of /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid files. If you have already installed dci-openshift-agent on your system, you should have an entry like this in both files:

    ```bash
    dci-openshift-agent:100000:65536
    ```

1. Copy that entry and paste it in both files, but setting the first value to dci-openshift-app-agent. If dci-openshift-agent is not installed in your server, then copy directly the line above and change the first value to dci-openshift-app-agent. Both /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid files should include a line like this now:

    ```bash
    dci-openshift-app-agent:100000:65536
    ```

1. To conclude, execute the podman system migration command, it will take care of killing the podman "pause" process and restarting the running containers with the new subuid/subgid mapping.

    ```bash
    $ podman system migrate
    ```

   If the containers do not restart automatically, then you can try to restart them manually.

    Make sure of changing the ownership of certain resources (e.g. the ones under /var/lib/dci-openshift-app-agent directory):

    ```bash
    $ sudo chown \
        -R \
        dci-openshift-app-agent:dci-openshift-app-agent \
        /var/lib/dci-openshift-app-agent/
    ```

    Then, you can retry to deploy the containers and it should work.

### Old Podman versions

It is recommended to use, at least, Podman 3.0 when running dci-openshift-app-agent, to avoid issues when pulling or building container images.

If `sudo dnf update podman` does not work, you may need to follow some of these steps:

1. Try to clean the cache just in case, and then list the available packages from the upstream repository to confirm if version 3 is listed. For example, for Podman 1.6.4, it is indeed provided by `rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms` repo:

    ```ShellSession
    $ sudo dnf clean all
    $ sudo dnf --disableexcludes all --disablerepo all --enablerepo rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms list --available --showduplicates podman

    # If version 3 is listed, then run again:
    $ sudo dnf update podman
    ```

1. Try to find issues related to the Podman version you are using and apply the workarounds proposed. For example, for Podman 1.6.4, there was a [bug](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/5306) related to the usage of rootless containers, in which it seems that, by removing .config and .local directories and starting from scratch, it fixed the issue.

1. Confirm that the container tools version that corresponds to Podman 3 is enabled or not, and enable it if disabled (as long as it does not impact in other workloads apart from dci-openshift-app-agent running in the server). It can be checked with the following command:

    ```ShellSession
    $ sudo dnf module list container-tools

    # If container-tools rhel8 is not enabled, type the following:
    $ sudo dnf module reset container-tools
    $ sudo dnf module enable container-tools:rhel8
    # And then upgrade podman
    ```

## Proxy Considerations

If you use a proxy to go to the Internet, export the following variables in the dci-openshift-app-agent user session where you run the agent, if you use the systemd service then it would be a good idea to store these variables in the ~/.bashrc file of the dci-openshift-app-agent user

Replace PROXY-IP:PORT with your respective settings and 10.X.Y.Z/24 with the cluster subnet of the OCP cluster, and example.com with the base domain of your cluster.

```ShellSession
$ export http_proxy=http://PROXY-IP:PORT
$ export https_proxy=http://PROXY-IP:PORT
$ export no_proxy=10.X.Y.Z/24,.example.com
```

> NOTE: Also consider setting the proxy settings in the /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf file if you use the Red Hat CDN to pull packages, otherwise the agent might fail to install dependencies required during the execution of the CNF test suite.

## Testing a code change

If you want to test a code change from Gerrit, you need to have `dci-check-change` installed on your system from the `dci-openshift-agent` package.

Then for example, if you want to test the change from <https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/dci-openshift-app-agent/+/22647>, issue the following command:

```ShellSession
$ dci-check-change 22647 /var/lib/dci-openshift-agent/clusterconfigs/kubeconfig
```

You can omit the kubeconfig file as a second argument if you want `dci-check-change` to re-install OCP using `dci-openshift-agent-ctl` before testing the change.

All the other arguments will be passed to `dci-openshift-app-agent-ctl`.
